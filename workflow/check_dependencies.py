"""Keep runtime dependencies declared in exactly one place.

`requirements.txt` and `[project].dependencies` used to hold the same nine lines. Nothing
compared them, and only one of them was ever audited -- `pip-audit` reads
`requirements.txt` -- so a dependency added to `pyproject.toml` alone would ship without
ever being scanned (Issue #16).

The fix is delegation rather than comparison: `pyproject.toml` declares its dependencies
`dynamic` and reads `requirements.txt`, so the two cannot disagree. This module guards the
arrangement itself, because the way it would break is not a mismatch appearing -- it is
someone re-adding a static list, at which point the drift is back and nothing says so.

The `--artifacts` half has since grown a second question of the same shape: not only
whether the declaration reached the distribution, but whether the files the application
reads at run time did. `packages.find` packages modules, and the web UI is data, so the
wheel shipped without the page `GET /` serves (Issue #55).

Deliberately line-oriented rather than parsed. `requires-python` is `>=3.10`, `tomllib`
arrived in 3.11, and the fast gate runs under whichever interpreter `scripts/bootstrap`
resolved. The facts being checked are exact declarations in files this repository owns,
not arbitrary values, so reading them as text costs nothing in precision. The structural
cross-check that a real parser affords lives in `tests/test_dependencies.py`, where it can
skip on an old interpreter without the gate itself going quiet.
