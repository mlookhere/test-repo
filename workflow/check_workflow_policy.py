    The advisory review is unprivileged by construction: no write permission, edit tools
    denied, forks rejected, prompt input sanitised. The job that *publishes* its output
    is the privileged one -- it carries `pull-requests: write` and comments on the pull
    request -- and the only thing standing between the two is the publisher's condition.

    Two properties, both load-bearing, neither implying the other:

    * It must name the Claude job's success. Drop that conjunct and the publisher runs
      on forked pull requests and on runs whose review produced nothing, because the
      fork guard and the label check live on the Claude job, not on this one.
    * It must exclude a cancelled run with `!cancelled()`. A status check function is
      what removes GitHub's implicit `success()` wrapper and puts the condition back in
      charge, which is what stops a superseded run reporting this job as cancelled
      (Issue #31). `always()` is the wrong function here and is rejected outright:
      GitHub documents `!cancelled()` as the alternative to it precisely because
      `always()` keeps running when the run has been cancelled -- on a write-scoped job
      that means commenting on behalf of a run that was already abandoned.

    A third property, about what the publisher does rather than when it runs: a job that
    turns the review into a pull-request comment must build that comment with the reviewed
    renderer. The envelope is model output steered by untrusted diff text, and the schema
    constraining it is enforced by the action in the unprivileged job, so the comment body
    has to be revalidated and contained by code that gates can actually read (Issue #41).

    Structure this reader cannot follow is a failure, not a pass. A flow-mapping job or
    a job name at the wrong indentation would otherwise take the publisher out of scope
    silently, which is the same class of bug as the one being fixed.
